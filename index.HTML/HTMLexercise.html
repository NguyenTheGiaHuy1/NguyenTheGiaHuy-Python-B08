    <p> "Mary Oliver is saving my life ."Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/the-anthologist">The Anthologist</a>," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Selected-Poems-Mary-Oliver/dp/0807068772">New and Selected Poems, Volume One</a>." A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block.

For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation:"I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They are very simple. And yet each has something."      </p>
